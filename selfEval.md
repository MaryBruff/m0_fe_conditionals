# Self Evaluation

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the comparison operators?

***I feel pretty confident with the comparison operators. I was a little overwhelmed during class but after I took some time today to go a but slower I get it!4/5***
----------
1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the logical operators?

***Same as above, I'd say I am more confident after taking more time to work on this assignment. I feel like I need a picture of the operators just so I am doing the right thing until I am even more familiar and have them more memorized.4/5***
----------
1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the if statements?

***I don't feel as confident with if statements but only just with writing them out. I can read them and know what to type but writing out the code takes me a minute. I think it's mostly because it has more components and I want to make sure I am doing the correct thing. So running the code in Replit as I writing has helped!***
---------- 
1. How much time did you spend on this lesson/topic? How did that line up with your time estimate?

***I spent about an hour and a half not counting the few breaks I took to eat and to walk to get some steps in. I noticed it takes me a little longer to work on assignments so I've adjusted my schedule accordingly.***
----------
1. What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?

***I still need to practice if statements. I am not sure if there is a resource to practice writing them out but I will look into it. I can always learn more especially on these foundational syntaxes because I know it gets more complicated. I have a few weeks off before MOD 1 and I do plan on practicing. So I am noting what I have struggled with or want to look more into and will do extra prep before then!***
----------
1. What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?

***I think my only question is I am wondering if it's okay to write and check my code in Replit? I still update my Vs Code and Terminal but I don't like checking my responses in Terminal. Is that okay? Is that bad practice? I plan on asking this in our next group meeting or chat!***

***Hope you can read this clearly Kim :D***
